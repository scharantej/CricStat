## Python Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that will be served when a user visits the root URL of the application. It will contain the user interface, including the input field, submit button, and output display.

### Routes

- **main_route**: This route will be associated with the index.html file. When the user submits the input, this route will be triggered and will process the input, generate the output, and render the index.html file with the output displayed.

### Design

```python
# Import necessary modules
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define main route
@app.route('/', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def main_route():
    # Get user input
    if request.method == "POST":
        input = request.form.get("user_input")

        # Process input and generate output
        output = generate_output(input)

    # Render index.html with output
    return render_template("index.html", output=output)

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Explanation

- The Flask app will use the HTML file **index.html** as its front end.
- When the user enters input and submits it, the **main_route** is triggered.
- This route processes the input and generates the output.
- Finally, the route renders the **index.html** file with the output displayed.
